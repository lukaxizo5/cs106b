# CS106B - Programming Abstractions (C++)

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from Stanford's 
**CS106B - Programming Abstractions** course, written in C++.

The course focused on **algorithmic thinking, recursion, data structures and abstraction design**.
## Assignments

Each assignment folder contains:
* Solution code in C++.
* Short description of the problem.

## Skills Demonstrated
- C++ fundamentals
- Recursion and backtracking
- Data structures and algorithm design
- File I/O
- Graph theory and pathfinding
- Abstraction and modular design

## Notes

* All files are structured and named consistently for readability.
* Visual interfaces were provided, focus was on implementing core logic.
* This repository represents the **final, polished snapshot** of CS106B work.
